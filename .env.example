# Same MySQL database as your Dastiyor website (BalwinderCa/dastiyor).
# Copy DATABASE_URL from your website repo's .env — use the exact same value so both connect to the same DB.
#
# 1. In your dastiyor website repo you have .env with something like:
#    DATABASE_URL="mysql://user:password@host:3306/dastiyor"
#
# 2. Copy that entire line into this file (as .env) in the dashboard project.
#    Do not run db:push or db:seed here — the website already created the tables.
#
DATABASE_URL="mysql://USER:PASSWORD@HOST:3306/DATABASE_NAME"
